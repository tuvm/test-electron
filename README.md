# Vinpearl OCR

Vinpearl OCR is an open source [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) app
based on [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). It is written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) and
uses [React](https://reactjs.org/).

## Building Desktop

### Verification

Verify you have these commands available in your shell and that the found
versions look similar to the below output:

```shellsession
$ node -v
v16.13.0

$ yarn -v
1.21.1

$ python --version
Python 3.9.x
```

### Building

You'll need to be inside the repository in order to build the application locally.

The typical workflow to get up running is as follows:

* Run `yarn` to get all required dependencies on your machine.
* Run `yarn build:dev` to create a development build of the app.
* Run `yarn start` to launch the application. Changes will be compiled in the
  background. The app can then be reloaded to see the changes (<kbd>F5</kbd>).

**Optional Tip**: On macOS and Linux, you can use `screen` to avoid filling your terminal with logging output:

```shellsession
$ screen -S "desktop" yarn start # -S sets the name of the session; you can pick anything
$ # Your screen clears and shows logs. Press Ctrl+A then D to exit.
[detached]
$ screen -R "desktop" # to reopen the session, read the logs, and exit (Ctrl+C)
[screen is terminating]
```

If you've made changes in the `main-process` folder you need to run `yarn
build:dev` to rebuild the package, and then `yarn start` for these changes to be
reflected in the running app.

### Running tests

* `yarn test` - Runs all unit and integration tests
* `yarn test:unit` - Runs all unit tests
  * Add `<file>` or `<pattern>` argument to only run tests in the specified file or files matching a pattern
  * Add `-t <regex>` to only match tests whose name matches a regex

### Debugging

Electron ships with Chrome Dev Tools to assist with debugging, profiling and
other measurement tools.

1. Run the command `yarn start` to launch the app
2. Under the **View** menu, select **Toggle Developer Tools**

When running the app in development mode,
[React Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en)
should automatically install itself on first start when in development mode.

An additional extension, [Devtron](http://electron.atom.io/devtron/), is also
included but is disabled by default. To enable Devtron, select the Console
tab in Chrome Developer Tools and run this command:

```js
require('devtron').install()
```
